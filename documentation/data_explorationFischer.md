Q&A

How is sales data structured? The dataset contains individual transaction records, each detailing the date, store_nbr, family of the product, sales quantity, and whether the item was onpromotion.
What is the scope of store coverage? The data covers sales from 54 distinct stores.
What is the temporal resolution? The data is recorded at a daily level, providing a granular view of sales activity over time.
Data Analysis Key Findings

The dataset comprises over 3 million individual sales records, providing a substantial volume for analysis.
Initial data quality checks confirmed no missing values across the core columns, indicating a clean dataset for immediate use.
Time-series decomposition revealed a significant upward trend in overall sales throughout the dataset's duration.
Strong weekly seasonality is evident, with sales consistently peaking on Saturdays and Sundays.
A clear yearly seasonality pattern exists, highlighted by a substantial increase in sales during December.
Store performance varies considerably, with Store Type 'A' and Cluster '5' showing the highest average sales figures.
Promotional activities have a clear impact, with items onpromotion demonstrating significantly higher average sales compared to those not on promotion.
The sales_lag_1 (previous day's sales) was identified as the single most important feature in predicting daily total sales by the Random Forest model, emphasizing the momentum of sales.
Insights or Next Steps

The identified trend and seasonality patterns are critical for developing accurate sales forecasts and optimizing inventory and staffing levels according to predictable demand fluctuations.
The variation in sales across store types and clusters suggests opportunities for targeted strategies; further investigation into the characteristics of high-performing stores (like those in Cluster 5) could yield best practices to apply elsewhere.
The strong influence of promotions indicates that optimizing promotional timing, duration, and product selection could significantly impact overall sales performance.
Exploring external factors like holidays, economic indicators, or competitor actions, as highlighted by the ARIMA residual analysis and model blind spots, could further enhance forecasting accuracy and provide a more complete understanding of sales drivers.
